## Getting Started
Unlock Artificial Island by reaching level 50 and accepting the quest at Banges Port.

> To build on the Artificial Island, you will need to be level 60 OR have 50% map completion on Artificial Island (inner region only).

## Construction
While on your Home Island, you can construct and upgrade buildings that generate materials over time. These materials are used for three things:


1. Upgrading buildings to generate more materials*
2. Currency in the housing shop (Limited Matrix pulls, Avatars, <a href="/mounts/crimson-meteor">Crimson Meteor</a>..)
3. Crafting Matrices

_*The Development Center must be upgraded to raise the max level of other buildings._

## Material Drops
Materials also drop from creatures on your island, including animals, normal mobs, and weakened world bosses. The higher the status of the creature (regular / elite / boss), the more materials will drop from it.

> Common enemies respawn every 3 days and bosses every 7 days. The timer starts when enemy is defeated. In CN, all creatures respawn at weekly reset.

Different creatures will drop different materials, but world bosses drop a large amount of all resources at once.
