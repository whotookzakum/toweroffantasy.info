    <h2>How we use your personal data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In this Section 3 we have set out:
            <ol class="letter-list" style={{ listStyleType: "lower-alpha" }}>
                <li>
                    the general categories of personal data that we may process;
                </li>
                <li>
                    in the case of personal data that we did not obtain directly
                    from you, the source and specific categories of that data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the purposes for which we may process personal data; and
                </li>
                <li>the legal bases of the processing.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            We may process data about your use of our website and services ("<b
                >usage data</b
            >"). The usage data may include your IP address, geographical
            location, browser type and version, operating system, referral
            source, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as
            well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your
            service use. The source of the usage data is our analytics tracking
            system. This usage data may be processed for the purposes of
            analysing the use of the website and services. The legal basis for
            this processing is consent or our legitimate interests, namely
            monitoring and improving our website and services.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may process your personal data that is provided in the course of
            the use of our services ("<b>service data</b>"). The service data
            may include the timing, frequency and pattern of service use. The
            source of the service data is you. The service data may be processed
            for the purposes of operating our website, providing our services,
            ensuring the security of our website and services, maintaining
            back-ups of our databases and communicating with you. The legal
            basis for this processing is our legitimate interests, namely the
            proper administration of our website and business.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to the specific purposes for which we may process your
            personal data set out in this Section 3, we may also process any of
            your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance
            with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to
            protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another
            natural person.
        </li>
        <li>
            Please do not supply any other person's personal data to us, unless
            we prompt you to do so.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Providing your personal data to others</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            We may disclose your personal data to any member of our group of
            companies (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company
            and all its subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the
            purposes, and on the legal bases, set out in this policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may disclose your personal data to our insurers and/or
            professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for the
            purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing
            risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise
            or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an
            administrative or out-of-court procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in
            this Section 4, we may disclose your personal data where such
            disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
            which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or
            the vital interests of another natural person. We may also disclose
            your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court
            proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>International transfers of your personal data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In this Section 5, we provide information about the circumstances in
            which your personal data may be transferred to countries outside the
            European Economic Area (EEA).
        </li>
        <li>
            The hosting facilities for our website are situated in the US. The
            European Commission has made an "adequacy decision" with respect to
            the data protection laws of each of these countries. Transfers to
            each of these countries will be protected by appropriate safeguards,
            namely EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
        </li>
        <li>
            You acknowledge that personal data that you submit for publication
            through our website or services may be available, via the internet,
            around the world. We cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such
            personal data by others.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Retaining and deleting personal data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            This Section 6 sets out our data retention policies and procedures,
            which are designed to help ensure that we comply with our legal
            obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of personal
            data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal data that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not
            be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those
            purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            We will retain and delete your personal data as follows:
            <ol class="letter-list">
                <li>
                    Cookie data will be retained for no longer than 30 days.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6, we may
            retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in
            order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of
            another natural person.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Amendments</h2>

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under
            data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all of
            the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you
            should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory
            authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your principal rights under the data protection law are:
            <ol>
                <li>the right to access;</li>
                <li>the right to rectification;</li>
                <li>the right to erasure;</li>
                <li>the right to restrict processing;</li>
                <li>the right to object to processing;</li>
                <li>the right to data portability;</li>
                <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</li>
                <li>the right to withdraw consent.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process
            your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data,
            together with certain additional information. That additional
            information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the
            categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the
            personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not
            affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
            first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies
            may be subject to a reasonable fee. Provision of such information
            will be subject to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the first copy will be provided free of charge, but
                    additional copies will be subjected to a $200 administration
                    fee; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for
                    this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your
                    passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original
                    copy of a utility bill showing your current address).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you
            rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing,
            to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
        </li>
        <li>
            In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
            personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the
            personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes
            for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw
            consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing
            under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the
            processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data
            have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the
            right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is
            necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
            information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
            In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing
            of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the
            accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose
            erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our
            processing, but you require personal data for the establishment,
            exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to
            processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where
            processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to
            store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process
            it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of
            legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
            legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
        </li>
        <li>
            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
            on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the
            extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the
            processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out
            in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority
            vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
            us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease
            to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate
            compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
            interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data
            for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct
            marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to
            process your personal data for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you consider that our processing of your personal information
            infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a
            complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
            protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual
            residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
            infringement.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your
            personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that
            consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of
            processing before the withdrawal.
        </li>
