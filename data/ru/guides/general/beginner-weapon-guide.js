                <h2>Example DPS Teams</h2>
                <h3 className="turquoise">Skill Based: Crow, Tsubasa, Marc</h3>
                <p>
                    The concept of this build is high energy recharge with Marc and Tsubasa, enabling me to spam Crow's discharge skill. Tsubasa also buffs my damage. Marc boosts survivability via his shields. In summary, this is balanced between offensive buffs, survivability and raw damage. Crow is kind of a special case as his plunge attack is extremely powerful.
                </p>

                <h3 className="turquoise">Raw Power: Baiyuekui, Tsubasa, Claudia</h3>
                <p>
                    While this build may lack shields, it has dmg, dmg, and more dmg. Bai handles the heavy lifting, shield break as well as having iframes during her active skill. Tsubasa and Claudia both are used to charge energy and buff damage. While it may not be as forgiving as builds with some survivability, it makes up for it with dmg output.
                </p>
                <h3 className="turquoise">A Balanced Trio: Marc, Nemesis, Samir</h3>
                <p>
                    While Marc needs dupes for his damage buff and more shields, it truly is worth the cost. Nemesis provides DoT, Heals, and energy, while Marc basically ensures u don't die with his shields. Both of them provide powerful buffs. Samir in this case provides energy as well as the big dmg, attacking safely from the air.
                </p>
                <h3 className="turquoise">Best F2P Team: Samir, Tsubasa, King</h3>
                <p>
                    King offers shield break, as well as DoT off his shield break. King also happens to be one of two options for DPS-type shield break, the other being Shiro. Tsubasa gives a 40% dmg buff as well as charges energy for switch skills. Samir carries dmg while safely attacking from the air. It also helps that this is a tri-elemental build so there is always the option of using a non-resisted weapon.
                </p>
                <h3 className="turquoise">Overall Best Team: 6★ Baiyuekui, Marc, Nemesis</h3>
                <p>
                    Bai breaks shields while having a very strong dodge attack and the highest damage in game as of now. Marc grants a 35% damage buff as well as shields making you nearly invincible. Nemesis provides a strong 50% lightning damage buff, as well as a powerful DoT effect often healing more than pure support healers.

                <h2>Example Tank Teams</h2>
                <p>
                    Much of the utility each weapon can provide highly depends on the amount of dupes you can get on the weapon. As such it's important to know what you want to work with. Personally, this ended up with me giving Tsubasa a lot of value because she provides a strong damage buff, as well as energy to charge switch skills more often.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    DPS isn't all that matters; ded DPS is no DPS. <br />
                    Some content hits too hard and you would benefit from having a tank.
                </blockquote>
                <h3 className="turquoise">The King of Tanks: Marc</h3>
                <p>
                    Marc enables you to use the Brute Force Resonance while still having insane survivability. In this game, tanks have an aggro buff and receive reduced damage, but if a DPS can maintain aggro through their damage while avoiding getting hit, <strong className="yellow">wouldn't a good DPS just outperform a tank?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes. However that doesn't mean tanks are useless. In specific end game content such as Frontier Clash (Hard) the boost tanks get in shatter is what you need to prevent annoying mechanics such as enemies taking flight. We all know how annoying a boss that jumps across the map can be, especially when you have long cooldowns.
                </p>
                <h3 className="turquoise">Massive Shield Break: Marc, Meryl, Tsubasa</h3>
                <p>
                    Meryl has the best breaking power, as well as CC immunity. Her switch skill can also trap enemies, thought it'll trap your allies as well… She also does decent damage with her spin attack. Marc provides shield, energy, a damage buff, as well as cc immunity. Tsubasa provides ranged damage, a damage buff, DoT arrow rain, and energy recharge to spam more switch skills.

                <h2>Example Support Teams</h2>
                <p>
                    Healer builds will typically want to run shield break to prevent boss ultimate abilities, but they can run full support as well. As there are only 4 support weapons a good build would be <strong className="yellow">2 from Zero/Nemesis/Coco, and a Shiro/Meryl</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zero provides shields as well has offensive buffs and heals to the party. He has a party wide 3 sec iframe, and charges switch skills too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nemesis has DoT from 3★ and HoT from 1★, while Coco has offensive buffs and cc immune from 3★, and a strong burst heal. At high stars Nemesis even offers noticeable damage which could be a good option for healer mains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meryl has the strongest breaking power while Shiro active skill boosts shield break efficiency and damage for party. She also has a skill cd reset when she breaks enemies shields from 3★.
