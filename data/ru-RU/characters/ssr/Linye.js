                When paired with two **Flame weapons**, the wind field is transformed into a flame wind field. When the burning BUFF is added in the wind field, the duration is increased by **5** seconds, and the player's own fire damage to the shielded target in the wind field is increased by **50%**.

                When paired with two **Volt weapons**, the wind field is transformed into a lightning wind field. Dodges have a **65%** chance of not being consumed while in the wind field. Each dodge will add **300%** AoE damage to the next Discharge skill, stacking up to **3** times for **900%** damage.

                When paired with two **Ice weapons**, the wind field is transformed into an ice wind field. When enemies in the field receive ice damage **10** times, they enter a state of frostbite for **15** seconds, receiving **20%** more ice damage. The number of hits to activate frostbite does not accumulate during the effect.

                When paired with two **Physical weapons**, the wind field is transformed into a physical wind field. Every time the target loses **1%** of its max HP in the wind field, you gain the corresponding health in shields within **3** seconds, can be stacked.

                When paired with two **weapons of different elements**, the wind field is not transformed. Gain **15%** attack for all elements while in the wind field.`
